Hi, I'm Harshita ðŸ‘‹
I am a Computer Engineering undergraduate at `Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women`, New Delhi. 

With a keen interest in AI, Data, and Software, I've embarked on a dynamic professional journey that reflects my passion and dedication. One of my recent achievements includes being in the `top 100` at the `2023 Google Solution Challenge`. 

I have also undertaken some research endeavors which include work in the domain of `Parkinson's detection using Speech` and `Machine Unlearning`.
